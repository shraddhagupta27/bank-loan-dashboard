# Bank Loan Portfolio Report 
A Tableau dashboard analyzing 35K+ loan applications with dynamic Month-to-Date (MTD) and Month-over-Month (MoM) KPI tracking to provide real-time insights into lending operations and portfolio performance.

## Overview
This project delivers an interactive financial analytics dashboard built in Tableau to help lending and risk teams monitor loan application trends, borrower characteristics, credit metrics, and repayment behavior. Using real-world loan application data, the dashboard enables stakeholders to evaluate portfolio health, detect high-risk segments, and make data-driven lending decisions.

## Problem Statement

Banks and financial institutions receive large volumes of loan applications every day. Without clear visibility into trends and KPIs, teams struggle with: Tracking loan application volume and approval patterns, Detecting portfolio-level risks such as rising DTI or high-interest segments, Understanding borrower behavior across demographics, Monitoring repayment performance and early signs of delinquency

A centralized Tableau dashboard solves this by transforming raw loan data into decision-ready insights with dynamic, automated KPI tracking.

## Dataset

The dataset contains 35,000+ loan application records, including: Applicant demographics, Loan attributes, Financial metrics, Application outcomes

## Tools & Technologies

- Tableau Desktop – visualization & dashboard building
- Excel / CSV – raw data sources

## Methods
- Data Preparation - Cleaned dataset (null handling, categorical normalization), Extracted time-based fields (month, year, application date), Created calculated metrics (DTI buckets, interest segments)
- KPI Engineering - MTD / MoM loan applications
- Dashboard Development - Designed a clean, multi-sheet Tableau dashboard layout

## Result 

The final dashboard:
- Provides a centralized view of loan portfolio performance
- Helps lending teams identify high-risk borrower segments
- Supports faster credit decisions through MTD/MoM monitoring
- Reveals trends in approval rate, interest rate, and repayment patterns
- Enables leadership to make more accurate and timely lending strategies

This project demonstrates strong expertise in Tableau visualization, KPI modeling, financial analytics, and dashboard storytelling.
